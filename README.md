# Sampling Assignment
Sampling:- It involves analyzing a portion of the overall data to reveal important information within a larger dataset. The task at hand involves exploring various techniques for sampling, determining the appropriate sample size and evaluating the effectiveness of different models.

<h2>Sampling techniques used:</h2>

**1)Simple Random Sampling without replacement:-** In this method of sampling, the data is collected at random without replacement i.e. each item has an equal probability of being in the sample

**2)Simple Random Sampling with replacement:-** In this method of sampling, the data is collected at random with replacement i.e. each item has an equal probability of being in the sample

**3)Systematic Sampling:-** In this method to form a sample, every Kth term or item of the numbered items is selected.

**4)Stratified Sampling:-** A sampling technique where the population is divided into subgroups (strata) based on a specific characteristic, and samples are taken from each stratum in proportion to the population.

**5)Cluster Sampling:-** A sampling technique where the population is divided into clusters, and a sample of clusters is randomly selected. Then, all members of the selected clusters are included in the sample.

**On these 5 samples we have applied 5 different models:**

1)Gaussian NB

2)Decision Tree Classifier

3)Logistic Regression

4)SVM

5)KNN
